            <b>Purpose: </b>This visualization is meant to give insight into governmental access, oversight, and restrictions imposed on social media sites.  The map below visualizes data privacy by country as well as highlights the forms of governmental oppression through censorship.  By visualizing the data facebook has released in its transperancy report we show the decrease in online privacy and increase in censorship by country as time progresses.  The four products included within this dataset are Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messanger, and WhatsApp.  This data includes information on how many government requests for private user data it receives and fulfillment rates, information on content restrictions based on local law, as well as data on service disruptions for years 2013-2017.
