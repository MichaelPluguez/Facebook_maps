    <h1>Government Surveillance of Social Media</h1>
  </center>

  <int1>
  <p>
    Government surveillance of social media and user data is on the rise worldwide, and over the past five years surveillance of
    Google and Facebook customers has doubled in countries like the US, India, the UK, Germany, and France. This visualization is meant to give insight
    into governmental access imposed on the top social media and data collecting sites Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. By visualizing
    the data these companies have released in their transparency reports we show the worldwide decrease in online privacy
      by region as time progresses.

        The four products included within the Facebook transparency dataset are 
        Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp.
        The Google transparency dataset includes requests on all data gathering 
        products released by Google Inc including its search engine, Gmail, 
        Google Plus, Google hangouts, and Cloud Storage platforms. The Microsoft 
        transparency data includes requests from its Cloud Storage, Xbox, Outlook, 
        Skype, as well as all other platforms owned by Microsoft.  Each of the 
        datasets spans years 2013-2017 and is viewable by year as well as a 
        customizeable section of years. It is important to note Microsoft's legal 
        pushback on govenmental access to customer data starting in 2013 highlighted 
        in our further research section below when viewing the decline in data 
        requests received.  For more information on each dataset visit our sources 
        listed below.
