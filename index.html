  <p>
    <b>Purpose: </b>This visualization is meant to give insight into governmental access imposed on social media sites. The
    map below visualizes data privacy by country. By visualizing the data facebook has released in its transperancy report
    we show the decrease in online privacy and increase in censorship by country as time progresses. The four products included
    within this dataset are Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messanger, and WhatsApp. This data includes information on how
    many government requests for private user data it receives and fulfillment rates, a line graph of the incline of data
    requests, and information on acces restrictions is to also be demonstrated for years 2013-2017.
